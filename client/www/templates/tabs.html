      <h2>Creating a Hunt</h2>
        <p>In order to create a hunt, you must be signed in on your personal account.
        Hunts can be private, so that only you can start the game using that hunt.
        Public hunts are available to everyone!</p>
      <h2>Starting a Game</h2>
        <p>To start a scavenger hunt with your friends, go to Choose a Hunt and choose
        a hunt from the list available. Click on each hunt for a further description of what the hunt entails!</p>
        <p>Once a hunt has been created, you will be given a game code, which you can give to friends so they can join your game. Click start once all your friends have joined and are listed in the game lobby!</p>
      <h2>Joining a Friend's Game</h2>
        <p>To join a game, one person in the group must have created a new game through
        Choose a Hunt. Enter the game code they were given and you will prompted for your team name and sent to the lobby of their game!</p>
